                <p>
                    Hi, you! My name is fanny, but many people call me fUnny haha, I love music, sometimes I even risk singing, and playing some instruments, like guitar and ukulele.
                    <br/>
                    Besides loving music, computing is my other passion, I love the feeling of power that computing gives me, which allows me to use it to help people around me, 
                    whether with a simple script or with a complex web project, it's very fascinating and challenging and that's what keeps me motivated.
                    My main areas of expertise are data science and web development.
