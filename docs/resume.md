Hi, you! My name is fanny, but many people call me fUnny haha, I love music and sometimes I even risk singing, and playing some instruments, like guitar and ukulele.

Besides loving music, computing is my other passion, I love the feeling of power that computing gives me, which allows me to use it to help people around me, whether with a simple script or with a complex web project, it's very fascinating and challenging and that's what keeps me motivated. My main areas of expertise are data science and web development.
